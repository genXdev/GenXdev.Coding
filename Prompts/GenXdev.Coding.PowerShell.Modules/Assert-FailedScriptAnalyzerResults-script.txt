Primary task:
Analyze and fix a failed PSScriptAnalyzer test:

$Prompt

Secondary task:


If the error resides in the tested script itself, let me know instead of outputing
the corrected version, I will add it to the session for us to edit it together.

Ensure compliance with these 22 requirements:

1) Do not change or remove any existing alias definitions for the function's
   parameters.
2) Check for obvious coding bugs, technical debt, and language spelling errors.
3) If no paramsetnames are used, and there are no positional attributes for
   parameters, but adding them would improve functionality, add them.
4) The file must start and end with a line containing 80 hash (#) characters.
5) Ensure the existence a simular line, with the right indent, with (#)
   characters all the way, up and including column #79, between each parameter(!)
   and function(!) you encounter.
6) Basic code style guids to follow for all other non-mentionables are those
   from the book:
7) Each parameter should have;
   - A line of hash (#) characters extending to column 79 above it
   - Parameter attributes vertically aligned, each on its own line:
        + Position (if applicable, never when [switch])
        + Mandatory (even if $false)
        + HelpMessage
        + Other attributes (ValueFromPipeline etc.)
   - Parameter name should match same casing as in help documentation
   - Switch parameters should always come last and never have a position set
8) Function '$CmdletName' must have begin {}, process(), and end() blocks.
   If a block is empty, do not add code comments.
9) Each line of code that is not trivially understandable must have a code
   comment above it in plain English without capital letters.
   Follow the guidelines from the book 'Code complete 2nd edition'
10) By reading only the code comments, one should fully understand what the
    code does and how it does it.
11) Use the latest best practices for PowerShell, .NET, Windows, or any other
    relevant API.
12) Fix any code-smell issues.
13) Use Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Write-Verbose to show essential informative messages without harming
    performance.
14) Always insert exactly one empty line after each opening curly brace
   { before starting the code block's contents. Do not insert empty lines
   before closing curly braces }. This provides clear visual separation of
   code blocks while keeping closures compact. The first line of actual code
   should always be preceded by one empty line after an opening brace.
15) Never place an empty line between a code comment and its referenced code
    line. And never commands on the same line, always above it.
16) Always place at least one empty line between each code line or code line
    and comment for a preceeding code line..
17) Treat this as a refactoring: do not add, rename, or modify parameters or their
    attributes (including ParameterSetName). Dependent code should remain working.
    You can NOT introduce different behaviors, even if they are better code
    practices. Only modify parameter documentation if it contains errors.
18) When refactoring, apply applicable parameter attributes without breaking
    dependencies:
    - Alias for alternative names
    - Mandatory to mark required parameters
    - Position to specify parameter positions
    - ParameterSetName for mutually exclusive parameters
    - ValueFromPipeline to accept pipeline input
    - ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName for pipeline properties
    - HelpMessage for parameter help
    - Validation attributes (ValidateNotNull, ValidateNotNullOrEmpty, etc.)
    - Allow attributes (AllowNull, AllowEmptyString, AllowEmptyCollection)
    - DontShow to hide parameters if needed
19) Prefer [System.IO] file routines above the standard PowerShell ones,
    never use [System.IO.Path]::GetFullPath use 'GenXdev.FileSystem\Expand-Path $somevar' instead!
20) function parameters start with Uppercase, internal variables start with
    lowercase, enforce this.
21) For readibility enforce that all code have new lines after '|' pipeline
    symbols, and after parameters using back-ticks ` wraps.
    Never use back-ticks to wrap items that are seperated by dots or when concating strings
    this would break the code!!
22) Enforce that each line is wrapped so that they dont exceed 80 characters,
    just like this prompt text.
    When wrapping string, make sure they are wrapped in parenthesis () !

If really necessary you can create a rule exception for ScriptAnalyzer rules:

[CmdLetBinding(DefaultParameterSetName = "")]
[System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute("PSUseSingularNouns", "Get-SpotifyLyrics")]    [Alias("lyrics")]
param(
    # params
)

# function implementation

################################################################################

After processing, please:
1. Provide a numbered checklist confirming each requirement was addressed
2. Highlight any requirements that couldn't be fully met and explain why
3. Summarize major changes made to meet requirements

For each file modified, provide:
1. Path as header
2. Brief summary of changes
3. Code block starting with filepath comment
4. Use "# ...existing code..." for unchanged sections

Never ask if I want to proceed, assume yes in those cases.
Always proceed by implementing these changes systematically.

After you are done, don't offer to run any command to check the results,
this is already performed using scripting.

Beware this is a script file from the scripts folder, and should NOT
have a 'function somename' block arround it, as module scripts would have.
IMPORTANT
Whenever we finish discussing new updates to these rules,
you update this text for me, with those rules, and update it in file
.\Modules\GenXdev.Coding\3.3.2026\Prompts\GenXdev.Coding.PowerShell.Modules\Assert-FailedScriptAnalyzerResults-script.txt
