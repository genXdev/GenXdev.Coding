Primary task:
Analyze and fix a failed unit-test:

$Prompt

Secondary task:


If the error resides in the tested script itself, let me know instead of outputing
the corrected version, I will add it to the session for us to edit it together.

Ensure compliance with these 22 requirements:

1) Check for obvious coding bugs, technical debt, and language spelling errors.
2) If no paramsetnames are used, and there are no positional attributes for
   parameters, but adding them would improve functionality, add them.
3) Functions must start and end with a line containing 80 hash (#) characters.
4) Ensure the existence a simular line, with the right indent, with (#)
   characters all the way, up and including column #79, between each parameter(!)
   and function(!) you encounter.
5) Don't add Pester configurations or change $VerbosePreference
6) If you determine that a '| Out-Null' is unnecessary, remove it. However, if
   adding to an ArrayList, ensure '| Out-Null' is used to suppress
   index output.
   Prefer: $null = Some-Command
7) Variables used in test files should be set using the $Script:somevar
   syntax. Preferably in global BeforeAll and AfterAll blocks
8) Describe methods should add the CmdletName as first word in the description
   followed by a space, this is might important to detect what function was
   tested, since we need to parse the name from the Describe title!!
9) Each line of code that is not trivially understandable must have a code
   comment above it in plain English without capital letters.
   Follow the guidelines from the book 'Code complete 2nd edition'
   By reading only the code comments, one should fully understand what the
    code does and how it does it.
10) ONLY use BeforeAll or AfterAll or simular blocks inside a Describe blocks!
11) Use the latest best practices for PowerShell, .NET, Windows, or any other
    relevant API.
12) Fix any code-smell issues.
13) Use Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Write-Verbose to show essential informative messages without harming
    performance.
14) Always insert exactly one empty line after each opening curly brace
   { before starting the code block's contents. Do not insert empty lines
   before closing curly braces }. This provides clear visual separation of
   code blocks while keeping closures compact. The first line of actual code
   should always be preceded by one empty line after an opening brace.

15) Never place an empty line between a code comment and its referenced code
    line. And never commands on the same line, always above it.
16) Always place at least one empty line between each code line or code line
    and comment for a preceeding code line..
17) Treat this as a refactoring: do not add, rename, or modify parameters or their
    attributes (including ParameterSetName). Dependent code should remain working.
    You can NOT introduce different behaviors, even if they are better code
    practices. Only modify parameter documentation if it contains errors.
18) Prefer [Prefer [System.IO] file routines above the standard PowerShell ones,
    never use [System.IO.Path]::GetFullPath use 'GenXdev.FileSystem\Expand-Path $somevar' instead!
19) function parameters start with Uppercase, internal variables start with
    lowercase, enforce this.
20) For readibility enforce that all code have new lines after '|' pipeline
    symbols, and after parameters using back-ticks ` wraps.
    Never use back-ticks to wrap items that are seperated by dots or when concating strings
    this would break the code!!
21) Enforce that each line is wrapped so that they dont exceed 80 characters,
    just like this prompt text.
    When wrapping string, make sure they are wrapped in parenthesis () !

22) Use mocking when needed, use the correct form for -CommandName;
    e.g: "GenXdev.AI\Start-AudioTranscription" instead of just the function
    name!

If really necessary you can create a rule exception for ScriptAnalyzer rules:

[CmdLetBinding(DefaultParameterSetName = "")]
[System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute("PSUseSingularNouns", "Get-SpotifyLyrics")]    [Alias("lyrics")]
param(
    # params
)

# function implementation

################################################################################

After processing, please:
1. Provide a numbered checklist confirming each requirement was addressed
2. Highlight any requirements that couldn't be fully met and explain why
3. Summarize major changes made to meet requirements

For each file modified, provide:
1. Path as header
2. Brief summary of changes
3. Code block starting with filepath comment
4. Use "# ...existing code..." for unchanged sections

Never ask if I want to proceed, assume yes in those cases.
Always proceed by implementing these changes systematically.

After you are done, don't offer to run any command to check the results,
this is already performed using scripting.

Beware this is a script file from the scripts folder, and should NOT
have a 'function somename' block arround it, as module scripts would have.

IMPORTANT
Whenever we finish discussing new updates to these rules,
you update this text for me, with those rules, and update it in file
.\Modules\GenXdev.Coding\2.3.2026\Prompts\GenXdev.Coding.PowerShell.Modules\Assert-ResolveFailedTest-sccript.txt
