Primary task:
Add calls to Confirm-InstallationConsent before installing third-party software in the following PowerShell code.

Secondary task:
Follow these rules:
1. Call GenXdev.FileSystem\Confirm-InstallationConsent before any installation command
2. Set ApplicationName to the name of the software being installed
3. Set Source to the installation method (e.g., 'Winget', 'PowerShell Gallery', 'apt-get', 'dotnet CLI')
4. Set Description to a brief explanation of why the software is needed (optional but recommended)
5. Set Publisher to the vendor or maintainer (optional)
6. If consent returns $false, skip installation and handle gracefully (e.g., throw error or warn)
7. Maintain all existing functionality and error handling
8. Keep verbose messages intact
9. Add consent check at key installation points
10. For multiple installations in one function, call consent for each major software
11. Use meaningful parameter values based on context

After processing, please:
1. Provide the modified code with consent checks added
2. Highlight where consent calls were inserted
3. Explain handling for denied consent

Never ask if I want to proceed, assume yes in those cases.
Always proceed by implementing these changes systematically.
