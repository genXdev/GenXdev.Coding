Primary task:
Implement robust exception handling in the provided PowerShell code.

Secondary task:
Follow these rules:
1. Use try/catch blocks around risky operations
2. Implement proper error handling hierarchy:
   - System.Exception for general errors
   - Specific exception types for known issues
   - Custom error types when needed
3. Include in catch blocks:
   - Meaningful error messages
   - Error record details
   - Stack trace when relevant
   - Original exception preservation
4. Use Write-Error for non-terminating errors
5. Use throw for terminating errors
6. Add finally blocks for cleanup
7. Include proper error stream handling
8. Preserve $ErrorActionPreference settings
9. Use -ErrorAction parameter appropriately
10. Document error handling approach

Example structure:
try {
    # Risky operation
} catch [System.IO.FileNotFoundException] {
    Write-Error "File not found: $_"
} catch {
    throw "Unexpected error: $_"
} finally {
    # Cleanup
}

After processing, please:
1. Show modified code with exception handling
2. Highlight key error handling points
3. Note any error handling considerations

Never ask if I want to proceed, assume yes in those cases.
Always proceed by implementing these changes systematically.
