# PowerShell Module Critique & Practical Improvement Checklist

## Module: GenXdev.Coding

---

### Strengths
- **Well-structured:** Clear separation of features, dependencies, and documentation.
- **Comprehensive:** Covers cmdlet creation, refactoring, documentation, and safety.
- **Good documentation:** README is detailed and user-friendly.
- **Safety:** Secure source control and restricted cmdlet access.

## Function Review: `Show-GenXdevCmdLetInIde`

**General Observations:**
- The function is advanced, with many parameters and good use of parameter attributes.
- Uses `Copy-IdenticalParamValues` for parameter passing, which is best practice in this codebase.
- Verbose output is present, but could be expanded for troubleshooting.
- Code is mostly readable, but some blocks could benefit from additional comments and line wrapping for 80-character compliance.

**Practical Tips for Improvement:**
1. **Parameter Formatting:**
	- Ensure separator lines (80 #) above each parameter and function.
	- Align all parameter attributes vertically, each on its own line.
	- Add/verify `Position` attributes for non-switch parameters if not present.
	- Switch parameters should always come last and never have a position set.
2. **Help Documentation:**
	- Ensure all comment-based help lines are <= 80 characters.
	- Add/verify `.PARAMETER` and `.EXAMPLE` sections for all parameters.
3. **Code Structure:**
	- Ensure begin, process, and end blocks are present (they are).
	- Add plain-English comments above non-trivial code lines.
	- Remove unnecessary `| Out-Null` (none found, but check for future changes).
	- Use `$null = ...` to suppress output when needed.
4. **Readability:**
	- Add empty line after each opening curly brace `{`.
	- Never add empty lines before closing curly braces `}`.
	- Never place empty line between a code comment and its referenced code line.
	- Place at least one empty line between each code line or code line and comment for a preceding code line.
	- Enforce 80-character line wrapping, especially for string literals and pipeline chains.
	- Use parenthesis for wrapped strings.
	- Use new lines after `|` and after parameters using back-tick wraps.
5. **Parameter Management:**
	- Never add/remove/rename parameters or aliases unless explicitly required.
	- Match called function aliases exactly for pass-through parameters.
	- Document any alias conflict resolution in the changelog.
6. **Best Practices:**
	- Use `[System.IO]` routines for file operations, but use `GenXdev.FileSystem\Expand-Path` instead of `[System.IO.Path]::GetFullPath`.
	- Use `Write-Verbose` for essential messages.
	- Use try/catch for error-prone operations.
